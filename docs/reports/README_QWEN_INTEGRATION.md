# Qwen2.5-Coder-Tools Integration

This document provides comprehensive information about the integration of Qwen2.5-Coder-Tools with the Text Chat Companion system, creating an intelligent dual-model architecture for enhanced coding assistance and general conversation.

## Overview

The integration adds a specialized coding model (Qwen2.5-Coder-Tools) alongside the existing general conversation model (Llama3.2:1b), with intelligent model selection based on query analysis. This creates a powerful system that can handle both technical programming tasks and general conversation with optimal performance.

## Key Features

### 🤖 Dual Model Architecture
- **General Model**: Llama3.2:1b for conversational AI and general queries
- **Coding Model**: Qwen2.5-Coder-Tools:7b for programming, debugging, and technical tasks
- **Intelligent Switching**: Automatic model selection based on query content analysis

### 🧠 Enhanced Memory System
- **Three-Component Architecture**: Context memory, database memory, and learning memory
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Distinguishes between coding and general conversation contexts
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite3 database for conversation history and learning patterns
- **Smart Context Retrieval**: Relevant context extraction based on conversation type

### 🔍 Advanced Code Analysis
- **Language Detection**: Automatic programming language identification
- **Code Pattern Recognition**: Detects functions, classes, algorithms, and debugging scenarios
- **Task Classification**: Categorizes queries as implementation, debugging, explanation, or optimization

### 📊 Comprehensive Monitoring
- **Model Statistics**: Usage patterns, response times, and confidence scores
- **Memory Analytics**: Context analysis, topic continuity, and recommendation system
- **Performance Metrics**: Response quality validation and model switching efficiency

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed and running
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Model Installation
```bash
# Install the coding model
ollama pull hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:7b

# Verify installation
ollama list
```

### Configuration
The system uses a configuration-based approach for model settings:

```python
MODEL_SELECTION_CONFIG = {
    'coding_model': 'hhao/qwen2.5-coder-tools:7b',
    'general_model': 'llama3.2:1b',
    'confidence_threshold': 0.6,
    'coding_keywords_weight': 0.4,
    'code_pattern_weight': 0.3,
    'context_weight': 0.3
}
```

## Architecture Components

### 1. Model Selector (`model_selector.py`)
- Analyzes incoming queries for coding-related content
- Calculates confidence scores for model selection
- Supports both explicit and contextual model switching

### 2. Qwen Coder Interface (`qwen_coder_interface.py`)
- Specialized interface for the Qwen2.5-Coder-Tools model
- Optimized prompting for coding tasks
- Enhanced error handling and response validation

### 3. Code Analyzer (`code_analyzer.py`)
- Programming language detection
- Code pattern recognition
- Task type classification
- Complexity analysis

### 4. Memory Context Analyzer (`memory_context_analyzer.py`)
- Conversation context analysis
- Topic continuity tracking
- Model usage pattern analysis
- Intelligent recommendation system

### 5. Enhanced Text Chat Companion (`text_chat_companion.py`)
- Integrated dual-model support
- Enhanced memory integration
- Comprehensive status reporting
- Improved error handling

## Usage Examples

### Basic Coding Query
```python
# User input: "How do I write a Python function to calculate factorial?"
# System automatically selects Qwen2.5-Coder-Tools model
# Response includes code examples and explanations
```

### General Conversation
```python
# User input: "What's the weather like today?"
# System selects Llama3.2:1b model
# Response provides conversational assistance
```

### Context-Aware Switching
```python
# Previous context: Python programming discussion
# User input: "Can you optimize this?"
# System maintains coding context and uses Qwen model
```

## Testing Framework

### Unit Tests (`test_qwen_integration.py`)
