In C programming language, the following are some of the basic components that you need to know:

1. **Variables**: Variables are used to store and hold values. You can declare variables using the `type name` syntax (e.g., `int x;`).

2. **Data Types**:
   - `int`: Whole numbers
   - `float`: Floating point numbers
   - `char`: Single character
   - `double`: Double precision floating point number
   - `bool`: Boolean value (True or False)

3. **Operators**: Basic arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %), comparison operators (!=, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), logical

An **algorithm** is a well-defined procedure or set of instructions that can be used to solve a specific problem, perform a particular task, or make a prediction. It's a set of steps that are followed in a logical order to achieve a desired outcome.

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is typically defined as:

* A finite sequence of mathematical operations (e.g., arithmetic, algebraic, logical) that takes input data and produces output.
* A procedure or set of instructions that can be executed by a computer or other digital device.
* A step-by-step process used to solve a problem, make a decision, or perform
